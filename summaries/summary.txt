Module -Wise Breakdown: Divide the project into 3 separate modules (e.g., GUI, ML, data visualization), explaining their purposes and roles. The system should handle user -defined inputs for memory allocation, page faults, and replacement algorithms (FIFO, LRU). Users shou ld be able to perform file operations like read, write, share, and view metadata securely. Users should be able to input custom disk access requests and see how the algorithms minimize seek time. Dynamic Load Balancing in Multiprocessor Systems Description: Develop an algorithm that dynamically distributes workloads across multiple processors to optimize performance and resource utilization.
